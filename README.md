##What is Cre8Fi?
Cre8Fi is a Web3 platform designed to connect content creators with projects looking for their services. It provides a decentralized marketplace where creators can offer services like graphic design, writing, video editing, and more. Additionally, we use an intelligent project-matching algorithm to help projects find the right creators based on their skills and portfolios. In future versions, creators will also earn rewards through our content point system, which will be convertible to tokens
